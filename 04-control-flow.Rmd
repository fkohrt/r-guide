# Control Flow

R is primarily a functional language, so you often don't need control flow yourself. But if you want to, go for it. If you can write some quick code with a for loop, go for it! Tell the R bullies to fuck off. Do what feels comfortable to you.

## If

Simple if
```{r}
a = TRUE
if (a)  
  print("a is TRUE")

# conditionally run multiple expressions
if (a) {
  print("a is TRUE")
  print("a is TRUE")
}
```

If Else
```{r}
x = 5
y = 8
if (x > y) {
  print("x is greater than y")
} else {
  print("x is less than or equal to y")
}
```

The `ifelse` function is the way to handle vector operations. It is like a vectorized version of ` ? : ` in C or javascript.
```{r}
x = 1:10
ifelse(x %% 2 == 0, "even", "odd")
```

## While

```{r}
x = runif(1)
while (x < 0.95) {
  x = runif(1)
}
```


## For

For works like foreach in other languages.
```{r}
a = runif(100, 1, 100)
for (x in a) {
  if (x > 95)
    print(x)
}
```
