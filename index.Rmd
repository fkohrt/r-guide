# About {.unnumbered}

This book is a short introduction to the R language. It covers the basics of R that are not covered by analysis and visualization guides like [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz). Consider it a quick way to get up to speed on R before diving into the analysis and visualization aspects.

This example-focused guide assumes you are familiar with programming concepts but want to learn the R language. It offers more examples than an "R cheat sheet" without the verbosity of a language spec or an introduction to programming.

# Prerequisites and starting up {.unnumbered}

The prerequisites in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#prerequisites) are the same for this guide:

1.  Install R for [Windows](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/), [Mac](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/), or your [variant of Linux](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/).
2.  Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).
3.  Run RStudio, and install the tidyverse by typing the following into the RStudio console: `install.packages("tidyverse")`

Check out the [section on errors](#error_install) if you run into any problems installing the tidyverse.

## Run Rstudio {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Whenever people talk about using R, they usually are referring to RStudio or a similar IDE. Don't bother with the weird GUI that comes with R.

## Working in a saveable file {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Writing code directly in the console gets annoying really quickly. So make a new R file for your code.

In RStudio, go to `File` -> `New File` -> `R Script`

You can now type and edit code in the file. To run a line, select it and press `Ctrl`+`enter` (PC) or `cmd`+`enter` (Mac).

Try copying this code into the file (not the console) and running it:

```{r}
2 + 3
```
