# Libraries and packages

A library or package is a collection of variables, datasets, functions, and/or operators.

It's called a "package" when being installed `install.packages("tidyverse")` and a "library" when being loaded for use `library(tidyverse)`.

A library and a package are the same thing, but R people will insist there is a difference. Whenever talking to R people, you've got a 50-50 chance of getting it right. If you get it wrong, you're going to get a short lecture. Just nod, and say "yes, that makes sense, and the distinction is clearly important". If you say anything else, you'll get a much longer more boring lecture.

I define these functions, so I don't have to worry about confusing the two.

```{r}
install.library = install.packages
package = library
```

If you only want to access one function or variable in a library without loading the whole thing, you can use `::`

```{r}
dplyr::band_instruments
```
