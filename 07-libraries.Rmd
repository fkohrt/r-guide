# Libraries and packages

A library or package is a collection of variables, datasets, functions, and/or operators.

A library and a package are the same thing, but R people will insist there is a difference. Whenever talking to R people, you've got a 50-50 chance of getting it right. If you get it wrong, you're going to get a short lecture. Just nod, and say "yes, that makes sense". Otherwise, you'll get a much longer lecture.

The only practical difference is that it's called a "package" when being installed `install.packages("tidyverse")` and a "library" when being loaded for use `library(tidyverse)`.

I use these functions, so I don't have to worry about confusing the two.

```{r}
install.library = install.packages
package = library
```
